# Route Finder

## Description

The aim of this project is to create a web-based service which allows for a quicker and more
efficient way to traverse a library or similar environment. Specifically, this app will be a
list of items, with the feature of giving you both:
 * The most efficient (based on distance to walk) order in which to pick up these items
 * A visual map of the pathway to follow

This idea builds on existing services from department stores, adding what we believe to be a
key feature of navigation around the building.
