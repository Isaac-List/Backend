# Store Shopping Project

## Structure
- How will the project be organized?
  - [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) setup (as in CS330)
  - More generally, developed in 3 domains: Frontend, Backend, Database
- How broad or narrow should the focus be?
  - Start small and broaden, adding features once we have MVP

## Languages and Technologies
- Platform: Web App
- Database: Could go with CS330 and use [sqlite3 w/Python](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_python.htm) on backend
- Languages to be used:
  - HTML/CSS: Consider using [Jinja templates](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) and a CSS framework
  - JavaScript: [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) if comfortable for some frontend, "vanilla" for backend

## Practicalities
- Scalability
  - Begin work with small dataset, scale up
- Partnerships
  - Local stores?
